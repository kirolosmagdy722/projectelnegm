            Artificial intelligence is not here to replace us. It augments our abilities and makes us better at what we do.
             Because AI algorithms learn differently than humans, they look at things differently. They can see relationships and patterns that escape us. 
             This human, AI partnership offers many opportunities. It can:
            <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
                <li>Bring analytics to industries and domains where it’s currently underutilized.</li>
                <li>Improve the performance of existing analytic technologies, like computer vision and time series analysis.</li>
                <li>Break down economic barriers, including language and translation barriers.</li>
                <li>Give us better vision, better understanding, better memory and much more</li>
            </ul>
       
        </p>

            Artificial intelligence is becoming good at many “human” jobs—diagnosing disease, translating languages, providing customer service—and it’s improving fast. This is raising reasonable fears that AI will ultimately replace human workers throughout the economy. But that’s not the inevitable, or even most likely, outcome. Never before have digital tools been so responsive to us, nor we to our tools. While AI will radically alter how work gets done and who does it, the technology’s larger impact will be in complementing and augmenting human capabilities, not replacing them.
            Certainly, many companies have used AI to automate processes, but those that deploy it mainly to displace employees will see only short-term productivity gains. In our research involving 1,500 companies, we found that firms achieve the most significant performance improvements when humans and machines work together. Through such collaborative intelligence, humans and AI actively enhance each other’s complementary strengths: the leadership, teamwork, creativity, and social skills of the former, and the speed, scalability, and quantitative capabilities of the latter. What comes naturally to people (making a joke, for example) can be tricky for machines, and what’s straightforward for machines (analyzing gigabytes of data) remains virtually impossible for humans. Business requires both kinds of capabilities.
