                Machine Learning involves the use of Artificial Intelligence to enable machines to learn a task from experience without 
                programming them specifically about that task. (In short, Machines learn automatically without human hand holding!!!) 
                This process starts with feeding them good quality data and then training the machines by building various 
                machine learning models using the data and different algorithms. The choice of algorithms depends on what
                 type of data do we have and what kind of task we are trying to automate.
                However, generally speaking, Machine Learning Algorithms are divided into 3 types 
                i.e. Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms, 
                and Reinforcement Machine Learning Algorithms.

                        intelligence is defined as a ability to acquire and apply knowledge. </td><td>ML stands for Machine Learning which is defined as the

                            knowledge or skill</td><td>DL stands for Deep Learning, and is the study that makes use of Neural Networks(similar to neurons present in human brain) to imitate functionality just like a human brain.</td></tr>
                   <tr><td>The aim is to increase chance of success and not accuracy.</td><td>The aim is to increase accuracy, but it does not care about success</td><td>It attains the highest rank in terms of accuracy when it is trained with large amount of data.</td></tr>
                   <tr><td>The efficiency Of AI is basically the efficiency provided by ML and DL respectively.</td><td>Less efficient than DL as it can’t work for longer dimensions or higher amount of data.</td><td>More powerful than ML as it can easily work for larger sets of data.</td></tr>
