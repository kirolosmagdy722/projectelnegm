            <p> In the first half of the 20th century, science fiction familiarized the world with the concept of artificially intelligent robots.
                 It began with the “heartless” Tin man from the Wizard of Oz and continued with the humanoid robot that impersonated Maria
                  in Metropolis. By the 1950s, we had a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers with 
                  the concept of artificial intelligence (or AI) culturally assimilated in their minds. One such person was Alan Turing,
                 a young British polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial intelligence. Turing suggested that humans use
                  available information as well as reason in order to solve problems and make decisions, so why can’t machines do the same thing?
                   This was the logical framework of his 1950 paper, 
                   <b><a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a></b> in which he discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their intelligence.

            <h3><b> Making the Pursuit Possible </b></h3>
            <P>
                Unfortunately, talk is cheap. What stopped Turing from getting to work right then and there? First, computers needed to 
                fundamentally change. Before 1949 computers lacked a key prerequisite for intelligence: they couldn’t store commands,
                 only execute them. In other words, computers could be told what to do but couldn’t remember what they did. Second, 
                 computing was extremely expensive. In the early 1950s, the cost of leasing a computer ran up to $200,000 a month.
                  Only prestigious universities and big technology companies could afford to dillydally in these uncharted waters.
                   A proof of concept as well as advocacy from high profile people were needed to persuade funding sources that machine intelligence was worth pursuing.
            </P>
            <h3><b>Roller Coaster of Success and Setbacks</b></h3>
            <P>
                From 1957 to 1974, AI flourished. Computers could store more information and became faster, cheaper, and more accessible
                . Machine learning algorithms also improved and people got better at knowing which algorithm to apply to their problem. 
                Early demonstrations such as Newell and Simon’s General Problem Solver and Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA showed 
                promise toward the goals of problem solving and the interpretation of spoken language respectively. These successes,
                 as well as the advocacy of leading researchers (namely the attendees of the DSRPAI) convinced government agencies such as
                  the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to fund AI research at several institutions.
                   The government was particularly interested in a machine that could transcribe and translate spoken language as well as high 
                   throughput data processing. Optimism was high and expectations were even higher. In 1970 Marvin Minsky told Life Magazine, 
                   “from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.” However,
                    while the basic proof of principle was there, there was still a long way to go before the end goals of natural language
                     processing, abstract thinking, and self-recognition could be achieved.
